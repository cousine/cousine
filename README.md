### Hi there 👋

I'm Omar Mekky, some people call me Mekky (pronounced Mek-Key), some call me Omar both are fine, and online I'm known as cousine or kechibi depending on where you are searching.

I’ve been a coder since I was 10 years old, went through the rise & fall of Microsoft Developer hype. Worked with C/C++, VB, C#, PHP, Java, and found my self in Ruby & Rails for a long time before adding Go and Elixir to my toolbox.

Founded a company called mash, worked day in day out with fellow engineers on fun and interesting products, then moved into mentoring and guiding fresh engineers through their career journey.

Taught career shifters to code in bootcamps and proud to have been part of 80 ambitious people’s journeys shifting their careers into programing.

Linux user and strong believer in Open Source ❤️, huge 🍕 & ☕️ enthausiast.
